# Introduction to the command line

The primary way you interact with (almost) all Research Computing resources will be via the text-only command line which will look similar to:

Before getting into ... there are some handy commands and shortcuts to keep..

## Command history

Linux keeps a history of commands you use in a file.  This is history is extensive but may not be exahustive.  Usually only last 500 to 1000 
commands you have executed will be in history.

## Less typing (sometimes)

The command line uses the history file in some useful ways that you should become familiar with as they will speedup your interaction (and save you some typing)

1. The up and down arrows will effectively scroll backward and forward in your history
2. Typing !! (known as bang bang, because the exclamation point is know as bang in Linux lingo) repeats the last typed command
3. ! along with one or a few letters from the start of the command repeats commands other than the last (most recent) one
