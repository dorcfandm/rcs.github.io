# Directory and file organization and management

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Understanding how directories and files are organized in Linux is perhaps the biggest obstacle when it
comes to gaining proficiency and confidence working with the command line.  This section of the tutorial will

1. Introduce basic concepts related to directory organization
2. Explain and demonstrate important commands to
    - Navigate to different directories
    - Show the contents of directories
    - Create and remove directories and files
    - Move/copy directories and files
    - Find directories and files


Hopefully after  going through this tutorial you will become more comfortable working with the the Linux command-line.

## Where's my file or directory?

Sometimes you will need to access a file or directory but you don't remember where it is or perhaps what it was called exactly.  That 
is where the `find` command comes in handy.

## Copying and moving directories/files

There are separate commands for copying and moving.  We will begin with the copy command which is `cp`.

`mv`

`cp`
