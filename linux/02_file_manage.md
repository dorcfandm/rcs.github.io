# File organization and management

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Understanding how files are organized in Linux is perhaps the biggest obstacle when it
comes to gaining proficiency and confidence working with the command line.

## Basic directory structure

- Absolute path
- Relative path
- Parent directory
- subdirectory

## Navigating directories

## Listing directory contents

The command to see the contents of a directory is `ls`.  By default it will list the contents of the directory
you are currently in ().  You can see the contents of other directories without navigating to them first if you 
add either an  absolute or relative path to a directory after `ls` .  For example:

1. `ls \data\neuronData`
2. `ls \mydata\something`

In addition, there are a few options you can supply to the `ls` command which will output additional useful information.

- `-l`
- `-a`
- `-h`
- `-S`
- `-R` lists files in current directory as well as files in all subdirectories, organized by subdirectory
