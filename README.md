# Research Computing Overview

This guide provides information and basic how-tos related to Research Computing resources. 
If you have any questions, please contact:

dorc@fandm.edu.

The current list of available computing resources can be found [here](overview/README.md).

## Acknowledging Research Computing

Use of Franklin and Marshall Research Computing resources must be acknowledged in any and all publications.

 - For research using the cluster:
   - "This work utilized the \<ClusterName\> Cluster at Franklin and Marshall College. \<ClusterName\> was funded through NSF grant \<GrantNo\>."

- For research using resources other than the cluster:
  - "The authors acknowledge Research Computing at Franklin and Marshall College for providing computational resources and support that have contributed to the research results reported in this publication."

## Courses using Research Computing resources

Instructors who wish to lead a class using any of the Research Computing resources must contact us at dorc@fandm.edu before the class begins.  This is to ensure that adequate resources and support are available.  At a minimum, we will need the following information:  

- A list (preferably a text file) of the netIDs of everyone who needs access
- Software needed 
- Typical computational work load (number of jobs or sessions, length, number of CPUs, etc)

In addition to the [compute resources provided here](overview/README.md) we also offer the following resources:

1. **math.fandm.edu** -- WeBWork server
2. **math-r.fandm.edu** -- RStudio server 
3. **jupyterhub.fandm.edu** -- Jupyter notebook server
