# Research Computing Overview

This guide provides information and basic how-tos related to Research Computing resources. 
If you have any questions, please contact:

dorc@fandm.edu.

A current list of available computing resources can be found [here](overview/01_resources.md).

## Acknowledging Research Computing

We are asking that use of Franklin and Marshall Research Computing resources be acknowledged in any publications (papers, grant proposals, posters, etc.).

 - For research using the cluster:
   - "This work utilized the research cluster at Franklin and Marshall College which was funded through NSF grant 1925192."

- For research using resources other than the cluster:
  - "The authors acknowledge Research Computing at Franklin and Marshall College for providing computational resources and support that have contributed to the research results reported in this publication."

## Requesting Research Computing resources for classes

Instructors who wish use any of the Research Computing resources should contact us at dorc@fandm.edu before the class begins to ensure that adequate resources and support are available.  At a minimum, we will need the following information:  

- Software you wish to use
- A list of the netIDs of those who need access
- How long you a typical software run might take (best guess)

We also offer the following specialized resources which can be used for classes:

1. **math.fandm.edu** -- WeBWork server
2. **math-r.fandm.edu** -- RStudio server 
3. **jupyterhub.fandm.edu** -- Jupyter notebook server
