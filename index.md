Research Computing User Guide
=============================

This guide provides information and basic how-to guides related to Research Computing resources. 

If you have any questions, please contact dorc@fandm.edu.

Acknowledging Research Computing
------------------------------

Use of Franklin and Marshall Research Computing resources must be acknowledged in any and all publications.

 - For research using the cluster:
  - "This work utilized the \<ClusterName\> Cluster at Franklin and Marshall College. \<ClusterName\> was funded through NSF grant \<GrantNo\>."

- For research using resources other than the cluster:
  - "The authors acknowledge Research Computing at Franklin and Marshall College for providing computational resources and support that have contributed to the research results reported in this publication."

Courses using Research Computing resources
------------------------------

Instructors who wish to lead a class using any of the Research Computing resources must contact us at dorc.fandm.edu before the class begins.  This is to ensure that adequate resources and support are available.  At a minimum, we will need the following information:  

- A list (preferably a text file) of the netIDs of everyone who needs access
- Software needed 
- Typical computational work load (number of jobs or sessions, length, number of CPUs, etc)
