Courses using Research computing resources
--------------------------

Instructors who wish to lead a class using any of the Research Computing computing resources must contact us at dorc.fandm.edu before the class begins.  This is to insure that our resources can meet your needs and if adequate resources and support are available.  At a minimum, we will need the following information:  

- A list (preferably a text file) of the netIDs of everyone who needs access
- Software needed 
- Typical computational work load (number of jobs or sessions, length, number of CPUs, etc)  

Acknowledging RC
----------------

Use of Franklin and Marshal Research Computing resources must be acknowledged in any and all publications.

"This work utilized the Alpine high performance computing resource at the University of Colorado Boulder. Alpine is jointly funded by the University of Colorado Boulder, the University of Colorado Anschutz, and Colorado State University."
