Courses using RC Resources
--------------------------

Students are welcome to use RC resources on their own for class projects and can request access as a regular UCB affiliate via the link off the RC homepage at: https://www.colorado.edu/rc.  When requesting help please indicate that the work is for a class project and any deadlines.  
If students are to be required to use RC resources for a class, see below.

Instructors who wish to lead a class using RC resources must contact us at rc-help@colorado.edu before the class begins.  This is to insure that our resources can meet your needs and if adequate resources and support are available.
Early in the process we will need to know details about the proposed class usage such as:  

- Number of students  
- Software needed, and if it will be installed by instructor/TA  
- Typical computational work (number of jobs or sessions, length, number of CPUs)  
- Date if 1st usage in class/lab  
- Class roster including TAs and auditors.  
Acknowledging RC
----------------

Use of Franklin and Marshal Research Computing resources must be acknowledged in any and all publications.

"This work utilized the Alpine high performance computing resource at the University of Colorado Boulder. Alpine is jointly funded by the University of Colorado Boulder, the University of Colorado Anschutz, and Colorado State University."
