# Connecting to servers

You will primarily use two commands/utilities to access Research Computing servers from your personal computer.

1. `ssh` to connect to a server and run commands
2. `scp` to copy files to/from a server

Before getting into the details of these two commands, there is some setup required on your personal computer in order to use these commands.
